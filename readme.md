# CPC Frontend Developer Task

1. Update the CSS to allow the page to look good on both mobiles and desktops.

    The current layout scales with browser size and becomes unreadably small on mobiles.  Update the layout to maintain a readable size on mobiles.  Ensure the hierarchy of stories is preserved and adjust the image sizes as necessary.

2. Load the articles from the JSON object provided in script.js.

    The contents of the page should be removed and built at page-load by the script.  Preserve the existing DOM design but allow flexability in the number of stories returned.

3. Validate the subscription form.

    Only allow the form to submit after the user has entered an email address and picked how they found us.  The email field should only allow valid emails.  Don't worry about sending the form data anywhere.
